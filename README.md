## Description

The p5js-ts-project is a creative coding project using p5.js, a powerful JavaScript library that makes it easy to create visuals and interactive content. By integrating TypeScript, developers can enjoy the benefits of static typing and better tooling, leading to more maintainable and scalable code. This template is perfect for those looking to explore visual art, animations, and interactive experiences with the added robustness of TypeScript.

## Features

- Interactive canvas for drawing and animation
- Support for various p5.js functions and libraries
- TypeScript integration for enhanced code organization and type safety
- Utilizes Vite, a fast development server and build tool that automatically bundles your project and refreshes the browser when changes are made
